# HabitCakes

**HabitCakes** is a simple web application for tracking and managing your habits. For now it's only a project I made for my OOP course, but will become a part of my portfolio in the future.
It's built with Flask and SQLAlchemy (SQLite for now). Frontend has some vanilla JS spaghetti doing things. 

## Features

- Add new habits with a title and description
- View a list of all your habits
- Mark habits as completed
- Simple and clean user interface
- Database support (SQLite by default, will migrate to PostgreSQL in the future)

## What is not there yet

- Habit progress tracking
- Soft delete by using is_active column in habits table
- Viewing habit details
- Account management
- Some security stuff


## What you need to run it

- Python 3.8+ obviously
- Dependencies (easy installation using requirements.txt)


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pancake-dave/habitcakes.git
   cd habitcakes
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   By default, the app uses SQLite. To initialize the database, run:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```
It also might not be needed since for the time being I push the migrations and instance to the repo (tables filled with test values).

3. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**

   Everything's default, so visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Development

- Code is organized using Flask blueprints and SQLAlchemy models.
- Alembic is used for database migrations (sometimes it freaks out a little, but usually works well)
- OOP and design patterns are demonstrated in the `oop_examples/` directory for educational purposes - it's my OOP course final project.
